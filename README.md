# Database fundamentals: Understanding RDBMS

## The purpose of RDBMS
- Collect & store related data
- Organize data into logical structures
- Data can be stored as tables & relations
- Fields can be used to store values
- Easily query the stored data
- Easily analyze stored data
- Allows real-time online data processing (OLTP)
- Data is consistently updated
- Short & fast inserts & updates
- Speed is fast
- Data is highly normalized
- Easily define schemas & sub-schemas
- Easily establish relationships between DB elements
- Provides the ability of independence of data from programs
- Provides backup & recovery features

## Popular RDBMS
#### Oracle
- High performance
- Spawn multiple database instances – instance caging
- 100% uptime – high availability
- Excellent backup & recovery features with low recovery time
- Highly secure

#### SQL Server 
- Insights from a data estate
- Multiplatform support
- High performance
- Allows easy data classification, protection & monitoring
- High availability
- Cloud-based
- Highly scalable
- Hybridization – part of database could be in cloud
- The software even tries to fix malicious activity if detected

#### MySQL
- Open source although owned by Oracle
- 2 licensing models – community, enterprise version
- **ACID** – Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Multimodal** – can support structured (based on SQL) & semi-structured data (based on JSON)
- Scalable & fast
- Memory based
- Built on client-server architecture
- Transactional
- Supports large databases
- **MySQL HeatWave** – In-memory query accelerator – designed for fast execution of queries, analytical & transactional queries

#### PostgreSQL
- Completely open-source
- Very good reliability & active community
- ACID
- Triggers can be programmed
- Stored procedures can be programmed
- We can modify source code
- Provides immediate consistency on a single server

## Feature history of Oracle DBMS
- Created by Larry Ellison

- Transparent data encryption
- Active data guard, secure files, exit data, data reduction
- Multi-tenant architecture, in-memory column store, support for JSON
- Active directory integration
- Online merging of partitions & sub-partitions
- Automatic index creation, real-time statistics maintenance, SQL queries on object stores
- In-memory for IoT data stream
- Support for blockchain tables, self-managing in-memory features
- Sharding advisor tools, property graph visualization, automatic zone maps

## Oracle’s future
Customers are slowly shifting to cloud databases but Oracle made the jump a bit too late. It’s hard for companies on Oracle to jump. They are working on their 2nd generation of cloud services to catch up with the competition.
